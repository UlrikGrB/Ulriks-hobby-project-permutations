# The purpose of this project is to produce all unique n-cells of 1 and 0. The program _final does this, building upon the 
functions _best and _how_many. I think theres many ways to produce all n-cells of 1 and 0, and my programme is probably not the fastest,
but neverthless, it was extremely fun. This was my first "big" project after reading the Book of R by Tilman Davis.
In the future I will try to tackle the problem with more efficient code #
